# [Instruction Title] - [Domain] Framework

**Purpose**: [One-sentence statement of philosophical foundation and operational integration]

**ContextForge Integration**: This instruction integrates Sacred Geometry principles, Context Ontology Framework (COF) dimensional analysis, Universal Context Law (UCL) compliance, and Work Codex philosophies into [domain] operations.

---

## Core Philosophy: ContextForge-Aligned [Domain Pattern]

### Geometric Philosophy (ContextForge Integration)

The [domain] framework operates through **Sacred Geometry patterns** that ensure structural integrity and operational excellence:

- **△ Triangle**: [Stability application - e.g., "Three-point validation (Build → Evidence → Coherence)"]
- **○ Circle**: [Completion application - e.g., "Complete workflow cycle with UCL compliance validation"]
- **🌀 Spiral**: [Progression application - e.g., "Upward progression with COF dimensional learning capture"]
- **φ Golden Ratio**: [Balance application - e.g., "Balanced effort allocation across dimensions (1.618... optimal proportion)"]
- **🔳 Fractal**: [Consistency application - e.g., "Pattern consistency across epic/feature/task scales"]
- **UCL Compliance**: [Law application - e.g., "No orphaned, cyclical, or incomplete contexts at any scale"]

### ContextForge Work Codex Integration

Every [domain] operation demonstrates alignment with the **11 Core Philosophies**:

1. **Trust Nothing, Verify Everything** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Mandatory evidence bundles and validation"]
2. **Workspace First** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Inventory existing artifacts before creating new ones"]
3. **Logs First** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Structured logging with correlation IDs throughout"]
4. **Leave Things Better** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Each phase enriches system for future work"]
5. **Fix the Root, Not the Symptom** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Address underlying causes, not surface issues"]
6. **Best Tool for the Context** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Dynamic tool selection based on effectiveness"]
7. **Balance Order and Flow** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Structured process with adaptive flexibility"]
8. **Iteration is Sacred** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Spiral progression with captured learning"]
9. **Context Before Action** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "COF dimensional analysis before execution"]
10. **Resonance is Proof** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Solutions harmonize across business/user/technical needs"]
11. **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion** → [How this principle applies - e.g., "Multiple perspectives in analysis and validation"]
