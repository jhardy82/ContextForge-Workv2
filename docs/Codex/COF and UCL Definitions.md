# Context Ontology Framework (COF) and Universal Context Law (UCL) — CF-Work Edition

## Context Ontology Framework (COF)

COF is the **structural backbone** of ContextForge Work. It defines how ideas, contexts, workflows, and projects are captured, related, validated, and evolved.

### Key Features

- **13 Ontology Dimensions**: Every context is analyzed across 13 axes, ensuring nothing exists as a flat record. Each axis contributes to the multi-dimensional completeness of the system.
- **Sacred Geometry Integration**: Every context must validate against the five sacred patterns — Circle, Triangle, Spiral, Golden Ratio, and Fractal — to ensure harmony, stability, growth, balance, and recursion.
- **Evidence Orientation**: Logs, metrics, and validation are mandatory. Contexts without evidence are treated as orphans and must be resolved or eliminated.
- **Pattern-Driven Relationships**: Links between contexts are geometric, reflecting resonance rather than arbitrary references.

### Purpose

- Organize knowledge as a **structured lattice**, not silos.
- Ensure every context is **multi-dimensional, evidence-backed, and traceable**.
- Serve as the ontology engine behind Idea Capture, Workflow Designer, and the API.

### The 13 Dimensions of COF

1. **Motivational Context** — Purpose, goals, and driving forces behind the work.
2. **Relational Context** — Dependencies, influences, and cross-links to other contexts.
3. **Dimensional Context** — Mapping across perspectives (scope, depth, and integration).
4. **Situational Context** — Environmental conditions, timing, and business circumstances.
5. **Resource Context** — People, tools, budget, and other assets required.
6. **Narrative Context** — Business case, description, and communication framing.
7. **Recursive Context** — Feedback cycles, iteration, and continuous improvement.
8. **Sacred Geometry Context** — Alignment with Circle, Triangle, Spiral, Golden Ratio, Fractal.
9. **Computational Context** — Logical models, algorithms, or calculations applied.
10. **Emergent Context** — Novel outcomes, lessons, or unexpected evolution.
11. **Temporal Context** — Deadlines, milestones, and time-related factors.
12. **Spatial Context** — Distribution across teams, locations, or environments.
13. **Holistic Context** — The unified view; synthesis of all other dimensions into coherence.

## Universal Context Law (UCL)

UCL is the **governing principle** that ensures all contexts remain coherent, traceable, and complete.

### Core Law

**“No orphaned, cyclical, or incomplete context may persist in the system.”**

Every context must:

1. Be anchored to at least one parent project or initiative (no orphans).
2. Flow toward resolution, closure, or transformation (no deadlocks).
3. Carry evidence bundles, logs, and AARs (no unverifiable work).

### Enforcement

- **Triple-Check Protocol**: (1) Initial build → (2) Logs-first diagnostics → (3) Reproducibility/DoD compliance.
- **Strategic Session Audits (3/6/9 cadence)**: Confirm alignment with COF, UCL, SCF, and process standards.
- **Compliance Gates**: Nothing is “done” until linkage, evidence, geometry, and closure are validated.

### Purpose

- Prevent **contextual entropy** (work falling into chaos or ambiguity).
- Guarantee the system remains **globally coherent and traceable** across all dimensions.
- Provide **universal guardrails** for both human and AI agents in professional environments.

## COF + UCL Together

- **COF** = the framework of how contexts are structured and analyzed (13D lattice).
- **UCL** = the law enforcing coherence, flow, and evidence completeness.
- **Together** = COF gives the multidimensional map; UCL enforces the rules of navigation. Both are grounded in Sacred Geometry and rigorous validation practices.
- **Both are implemented and enforced** through the CF-Work platform, ensuring all work is structured, traceable, and aligned with organizational goals.
