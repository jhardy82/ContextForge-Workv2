# Test Suite Catalog (Initial Inventory)

Generated by `scripts/Inventory-TestFiles.ps1` (initial run placeholder). This document will be regenerated as the refactor sprint progresses.

## Purpose

Provide a baseline inventory of all test files (PowerShell Pester `*.Tests.ps1` and Python `test_*.py` / `*_test.py`) including:

- Relative path
- Line count (approximate)
- Category heuristic (python_unit, pester_suite, integration, performance, governance, orchestrator, python_misc)

## Summary (to be filled after first automated run)

| Metric                  | Value                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Total Test Files        | 250                  |
| Python Files            | 102                  |
| PowerShell Pester Files | 148                  |
| Longest File (Lines)    | 718                  |
| Generated (UTC)         | 2025-09-02T17:26:55Z |

## Planned Enhancements

1. Add refactor status column (marker `# Refactored:` or `# Refactored YYYY-MM-DD`).
2. Track technical debt tags (duplicate setup, slow, flaky, missing-fixture, legacy-host51).
3. Separate integration/performance suites for focused gating.

## Categories Heuristic

| Category     | Description                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| python_unit  | Standard pytest-style unit test file                 |
| python_misc  | Python file under tests not matching standard naming |
| pester_suite | PowerShell Pester test file (\*.Tests.ps1)           |
| integration  | Cross-component or DB / API integration tests        |
| performance  | Performance or load / metrics tests                  |
| governance   | Governance / compliance verification tests           |
| orchestrator | Orchestration workflow tests                         |

## Inventory (Excerpt Placeholder)

Will be populated after first scripted execution and subsequent commit.
