### 2025-08-28T00:26Z – Test Harness UX Enhancements
Tasks: (ad-hoc) run_tests selector expansion & early-exit messaging
Change Summary:
- Added bare test function name expansion in `python/run_tests.py` (maps `test_something` → `path/to/test_file.py::test_something`).
- Enhanced `python/show_latest_test_summary.py` to surface `early_exit_reason` and collection miss details instead of falsely reporting "All tests passed".
Validation:
- Executed full Python test task; harness ran, environment & lock manifests emitted; no early exit; summary logic exercised implicitly (next run will reflect changes on early-exit scenario).
Risks New:
- Potential slight performance cost scanning test files for bare names (bounded by simple string search).
Mitigation:
- Only executes when user supplies positional selectors; could add caching if future perf issue observed.
Next Intent:
- Add explicit unit tests for selector expansion & early-exit reporting.
Outcome: improvement deployed; awaiting follow-up tests.
