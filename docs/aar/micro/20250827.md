### 2025-08-27T00:55:10Z Burst Promotion Event Completion
Tasks: T-ULOG-BURST-PROMO
Project: P-UNIFIED-LOG
Summary: Converted burst selector timestamps to timezone-aware UTC, marked task done, updated tracker heartbeat, appended completion action, validated CLI & promotion tests still pass.
Validation: pytest unit + CLI tests (burst selector + promotion) green; no functional regressions. Remaining deprecated utcnow usages logged (warnings) in other modules.
Risks_New: Residual utcnow() usage may later break under future Python removal; console script packaging still triggers ModuleNotFound fallback in tests.
Next_Intent: 1) Replace remaining utcnow() calls with datetime.now(datetime.UTC) helper, 2) Refactor packaging (move python/ modules under src/ or add package config) to eliminate fallback, 3) Update conftest action_id generation to timezone-aware.
Evidence: trackers/csv/actions.csv ACT-20250827-0018; trackers/csv/tasks.csv status change; tests output (local run) with passing status.

### 2025-08-27T22:35:00Z Command Exec Stream Collapse
Tasks: T-ULOG-ROTATION
Summary: Implemented command_exec helper collapsing stdout/stderr, added test_command_exec_capture, integrated into plugin tests, updated rotation task with new actions & quality gate metrics (3 tests, coverage 80%).
Validation: command_exec test passed; plugin tests invoking helper (pending occasional slow completion observation); rotation tests present. Verified command_exec event recorded in JSONL.
Risks_New: Intermittent plugin test slowdown (xdist auto-detect) may add latency; need explicit disable env or dependency pin.
Next_Intent: Document command_exec event in README-UnifiedLogger; expose metrics aggregation for command_exec counts; possibly reduce default timeout to 30s.
Evidence: src/command_exec.py, tests/python/test_command_exec_capture.py, updated trackers/tasks/task.T-ULOG-ROTATION.yaml actions.

### 2025-08-27T23:59:00Z Readiness Migration Closure
Tasks: (no tracker task resolved in session – DB authority fallback) Export entity extensions & enforcement (implicit)
Project: P-READINESS-MIG
Summary: Added export commands for projects and sprints, introduced SHA-256 hashing for export artifacts, implemented optional --enforce hard block for direct CSV edits, added tests for new exports and enforcement path.
Validation: pytest export/hash chain tests + new entity export tests passed (green). Manual CLI invocation confirmed artifact_emit with hash values.
Risks_New: Enforce mode may terminate with exit 4 if legacy CSV touched mid-run; documented in help. Hash overhead minimal.
Next_Intent: Add governance test verifying deprecated-csv label presence; integrate chain length + export hash summary into session_summary; consider migrating tasks list to DB-only soon.
Evidence: dbcli.py (_detect_direct_csv_edits enforce, _export_entity, export_projects, export_sprints), tests/python/test_dbcli_export_entities.py, artifact hashes in logs.
