## Entry: Test Execution Oversight & Governance Batch Continuation
- Timestamp: 2025-08-26T19:30:00Z
- Tasks: T-COPILOT-INTERROGATION (in_progress); T-REDIR-LINT-INTEGRATE (in_progress); T-SPARSE-AUDIT-GATE (in_progress); T-DUAL-RUN-EVIDENCE (in_progress)
- Change Summary: Duplicated conversation tracker tasks cleaned (deduped T-COPILOT-INTERROGATION). Added governance tasks for redirection lint, sparse audit, dual-run evidence. Executed multiple pytest invocations (`python/run_tests.py`, targeted `pytest -q` runs) without first capturing prior command exit details, leading to insufficient verification before assuming silent failures. Verified unified_logging/core.py refactor content (rotation simplification). No immediate code changes after discovering need for better verification cadence.
- Issue: Over-executed test commands without inspecting their completion status (Exit Code 1 from harness not immediately analyzed); absence of captured stderr made root cause unclear.
- Root Cause: Skipped intermediate step of fetching terminal output after each run; no consolidated test result artifact consulted before subsequent invocations.
- Impact: Lost time in diagnosis; potential to misattribute failure to rotation refactor instead of harness/test collection specifics.
- Validation: Post-review reading of core file shows no syntax errors; pending retrieval of actual pytest output from the failing run for categorization.
- Remediation Actions: (1) Capture terminal output immediately after any test run (fetch terminal tool) before re-running. (2) Add step to log summarized pytest results JSON (pytest --maxfail=1 --json-report) in future runs for deterministic evidence. (3) Update Local-CI to persist last test exit code and short summary artifact.
- Follow-Up Intent: Retrieve last test run terminal output; re-run pytest with `-vv --maxfail=1` capturing output; generate dual-run evidence; update tasks actions_taken fields with remediation. Consider adding a governance rule enforcing single-run-before-retry with mandatory evidence capture.
- Risks New: Repeated blind retries could mask flaky tests; missing structured report slows triage.
- Lessons: Maintain disciplined verify-before-repeat cycle; instrument test harness to emit lightweight JSON summary for each run.
- Shape: Triangle (discipline & verification foundation reinforcement).
