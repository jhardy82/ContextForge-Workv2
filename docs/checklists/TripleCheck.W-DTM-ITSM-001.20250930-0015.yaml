# === TRIPLE-CHECK VALIDATION: DTM ITSM Interface Enhancement ===

validation_methodology:
  approach: "Systematic three-layer validation with branched analysis"
  layers: ["Instinctual Assessment", "Logical Analysis", "Reproducibility Verification"]
  confidence_target: "≥0.95 across all validation domains"

  gut_check_overall:
    assessment: "POSITIVE - Strong foundation with clear implementation path"
    confidence: 0.91
    reasoning: |
      Instinctual response to project artifacts and approach feels solid. The incremental
      enhancement strategy aligns well with professional software development practices.
      Planning comprehensiveness suggests thorough preparation. Minor uncertainty around
      stakeholder alignment and MCP compatibility testing execution details.
