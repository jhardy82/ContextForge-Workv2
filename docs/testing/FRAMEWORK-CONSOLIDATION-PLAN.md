# FRAMEWORK CONSOLIDATION PLAN

## Environment Analysis Outcomes

### Configured Correctly
- **Test Frameworks**: The current test frameworks in use are functioning as intended and meet the basic requirements for unit testing.
- **CI/CD Integration**: The integration with GitHub Actions is operational, allowing for automated testing on pull requests.

### Needs Adjustment or Reconsideration
1. **Redundant Frameworks**: Multiple testing frameworks are being used for similar purposes, leading to unnecessary complexity.
   - Recommendation: Consolidate to a single framework that meets all testing needs.

2. **Documentation Gaps**: Some testing procedures lack comprehensive documentation, making it difficult for new team members to onboard effectively.
   - Recommendation: Update and standardize documentation across all testing frameworks.

3. **Test Coverage**: Current test coverage is below the desired threshold, indicating areas that require additional tests.
   - Recommendation: Identify critical areas lacking tests and prioritize their coverage.

### Prioritized Adjustments
1. Consolidate testing frameworks to reduce redundancy.
2. Enhance documentation for clarity and accessibility.
3. Increase test coverage in critical areas identified during the analysis.

### Considerations for Future Research
- Explore emerging testing frameworks that may offer better performance or features.
- Investigate best practices from industry leaders regarding testing framework consolidation and maintenance.
