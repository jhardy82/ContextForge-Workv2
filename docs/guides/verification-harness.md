# ContextForge Verification Harness — Usage Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the usage, workflow, and expected outputs of the verification harness implemented for Phase C1 Step-1.5.

---

## Purpose
- Run all repo quality gates (PSSA, Pester, environment check)
- Compare current results to the baseline snapshot (from Communication-to-ChatGPT.md)
- Enforce client-facing sanitization mapping
- Log an AAR entry with delta metrics
- Output a manifest.json summarizing pass/fail, deltas, artifacts, logs, and AAR path

---

## Usage

```powershell
# From repo root
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\src\utilities\verification-harness\Invoke-VerificationHarness.ps1
```

### Parameters
- `-TargetPath` (optional): Path to repo or prototype root (default: repo root)
- `-BaselinePath` (optional): Path to baseline metrics (default: Communication-to-ChatGPT.md)
- `-OutputDirectory` (optional): Where to write manifest/logs (default: ./Outputs/VerificationHarness)

---

## Example Run

```powershell
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\src\utilities\verification-harness\Invoke-VerificationHarness.ps1 -OutputDirectory .\Outputs\VerificationHarness
```

- Produces:
  - `manifest.json` (summary, deltas, logs, AAR path)
  - AAR JSONL entry in `/AAR/AwaitingAnalysis/`
  - Full logs for PSSA, Pester, environment check, and sanitization

---

## Output Artifacts
- `manifest.json`: Pass/fail, delta metrics, artifact paths, logs, AAR path
- AAR JSONL: Baseline, current, delta, compliance, evidence
- All referenced artifacts (PSSA-Report.json, Pester-Results-NUnit.xml, etc.)

---

## Test Coverage
- Tests in `/tests/utilities/verification-harness/Test-VerificationHarness.ps1` validate:
  - Gate execution
  - Baseline delta calculation
  - Sanitization enforcement
  - AAR entry correctness
  - Idempotency

---

## Compliance
- UCL, SCF, COF, Sacred Geometry φ⁵
- Dodecahedron shape, Tooling_Hardening stage
- 100% sanitization accuracy in client-facing mode
