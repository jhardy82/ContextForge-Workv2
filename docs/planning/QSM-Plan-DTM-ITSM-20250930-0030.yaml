  goal: "Create DTM implementation plan for W-DTM-ITSM-001 with full task hierarchy and MCP integration"
  assumptions:
    - "DTM API is available and authenticated (verified)"
    - "QSE research artifacts are complete and validated (confidence 0.97)"
    - "Implementation authorization granted from Phase 4 validation"
    - "MCP automation compatibility testing will be executed during implementation"
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "DTM Plan created with objectives, KPIs, and target environment"
    - "DTM Tasks created for all ExecutionPlan checklist items with dependencies"
    - "QSM events emitted with proper lifecycle tracking"
    - "QSM.Handoff.yaml created and schema-validated"
    - "Security redaction applied to all sensitive data"
