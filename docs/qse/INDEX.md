# QSE Documentation Index

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `QSE-Project-Checklist.md` | QSE project-level checklist for phases, evidence bundles, and COF/UCL alignment. |
| `../validation/QSE-Validation-Framework.md` | Canonical QSE validation gates, triple-check protocol, and SME confidence thresholds. |

Use this index as the starting point for Quantum Sync Engine work: scope via the project checklist, then align tests and evidence using the validation framework.
