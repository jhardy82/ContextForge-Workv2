# Synchronization Strategy
sync_strategy:
  approach: "Complementary Co-existence"
  rationale: "Todo MCP and DTM serve different but complementary roles in task management"

  todo_mcp_role:
    - "Agent working memory for current session tasks"
    - "Rapid iteration and status tracking"
    - "Phase-specific workflow management"

  dtm_role:
    - "Persistent task database for long-term tracking"
    - "Cross-session task continuity"
    - "Comprehensive workspace task management"

  integration_points:
    milestone_tasks:
      description: "Major QSE phase completions should be recorded in DTM"
      implementation: "Create DTM tasks for significant QSE milestones"

      description: "DTM tasks should reference QSE artifacts and vice versa"
      implementation: "Cross-reference system using task IDs and artifact paths"

    status_propagation:
      description: "Critical status changes should propagate between systems"
      implementation: "Automated sync for high-priority task completions"

# Drift Resolution Protocol
resolution_protocol:
  detection_frequency: "Per QSE phase transition"
  conflict_resolution:
    - "Todo MCP takes precedence for active session tasks"
    - "DTM takes precedence for historical and cross-session tasks"
    - "Manual review required for high-impact conflicts"

  sync_direction_matrix:
    todo_to_dtm:
      - "Phase completion milestones"
      - "Major deliverable achievements"
      - "Blocking issue resolutions"

      - "Cross-references and relationships"

# Implementation Plan
implementation:
  phase_5_1_complete:
    detection_algorithm: "Implemented comparison logic for task differential analysis"
    findings: "Minimal overlap detected - systems serve complementary roles effectively"
    recommendations:
      - "Maintain separate scopes with strategic integration points"
      - "Implement milestone synchronization protocol"
      - "Create cross-reference mapping for related tasks"

  next_steps:
    - "Phase 5.2: Verify Memory MCP alignment with both systems"
    - "Phase 5.3: Create integration validation tests"
    - "Phase 5.4: Execute governance validation"
    - "Phase 5.5: Generate handoff artifacts"
