# === SYNCHRONIZATION DECISIONS ===
sync_decisions:
  decision_matrix:
    - scenario: "Artifact newer than task record"
      direction: "QSE→CF_CLI"
      rationale: "QSE artifacts contain latest validation evidence"
      auto_resolve: true

    - scenario: "Task status updated without artifact"
      direction: "CF_CLI→QSE"
      rationale: "CF_CLI is authoritative for task state management"
      auto_resolve: false

    - scenario: "Memory pattern conflicts with current approach"
      direction: "MANUAL_REVIEW"
      rationale: "Memory patterns require human validation before override"
      auto_resolve: false

    - scenario: "copilot-tracking mirrors out of date"
      direction: "CF_CLI→copilot-tracking"
      rationale: "Mirrors should reflect current CF_CLI state"
