# DATA FRESHNESS ANALYSIS
data_freshness:
  fresh_sources:
    - "CF_CLI Context.json (2025-09-24)"
    - "MCP Todos (current session)"
    - "QSE Session Logs (active)"
    - "Terminal execution results (current)"
    - "Constitutional framework validation (today)"

  stale_sources:

    fresh_data_weight: 0.90
    stale_data_impact: 0.15
    temporal_validation: "Active and monitoring"

# MEMORY BANK REFRESH RECOMMENDATIONS
memory_bank_refresh:
  priority: "MEDIUM"
  rationale: "Stale memory bank files reduce coherence but fresh operational data provides accurate current context"

  files_needing_refresh:
    - activeContext.md: "Update with Phase 1 completion and Phase 2 readiness"
    - progress.md: "Add constitutional framework fixes and testing validation"
    - projectbrief.md: "Update with current achievement engine status and testing infrastructure"

  recommended_approach:
    - "Maintain QSE YAML artifacts as authoritative"
    - "Update memory bank narratives as human-readable summaries"
    - "Preserve historical context while adding current state"

# CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE VALIDATION

  cof_dimensions_applied:
    - Identity: "Plan refresh task clearly identified"
    - Intent: "Update tracking files and refresh plan understanding"
    - Stakeholders: "User, QSE system, constitutional framework"
    - Context: "Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready"
    - Scope: "Tracking updates and plan understanding refresh"
    - State: "Operational with validated infrastructure"
    - Evidence: "MCP updates, session log updates, sync report"

  ucl_compliance:
    - Verifiability: "All claims supported by evidence in tracking files"
    - Precedence: "QSE methodology applied consistently"
    - Provenance: "Clear audit trail in sync report"
    - Reproducibility: "Process documented for future reference"
    - Integrity: "Source materials preserved and referenced"
