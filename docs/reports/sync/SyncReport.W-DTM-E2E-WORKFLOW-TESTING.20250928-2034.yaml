decision_matrix:

  rationale: "DTM lacked proper task metadata; MCP Todos provided source of truth for task details from 5-branch classification"
  approval: "automated_sync_protocol"

  immediate:
    - "Begin work on urgent DTM fixes (Export and Server Stability)"
    - "Monitor DTM task status changes"
    - "Update MCP Todos as work progresses"
  strategic:
    - "Implement automated sync monitoring"
    - "Establish regular sync validation schedule"
    - "Create sync failure alerting mechanism"
