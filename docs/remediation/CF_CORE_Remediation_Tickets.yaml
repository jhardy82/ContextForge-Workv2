    description: |
      Parse `.QSE/v2/artifacts/P-CF-SPECTRE-001/DeprecationLog.IntegrationGuide.P-CF-SPECTRE-001.20251110.yaml` into a normalized index:
      component, deprecated_version/date, replacement/target, status, notes.
    remediation_steps:
      - Read YAML and extract deprecations to a structured dataset (YAML/CSV).
      - Normalize component names to match CLI inventory (cf_cli.py, dbcli.py, tasks_cli.py, sprints_cli.py, projects_cli.py, TaskMan‑v2 CLI, bridges).
      - Save authoritative index to `.QSE/v2/Indexes/Deprecations.index.yaml`.
      - Link index in report §6–7 and lifecycle matrix (REM-002).
