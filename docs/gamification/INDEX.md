# Gamification Documentation Index

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Gamification-Project-Checklist.md` | High-level gamification project checklist, including personas, nudges, and evidence tracking. |
| `../logs/cf_gamification_nudge02_engine.jsonl` | Reference log stream for nudge engine runs (for validation and analysis). |

Use this index to coordinate gamification work: start from the checklist, then mine logs and validation artifacts as evidence.
